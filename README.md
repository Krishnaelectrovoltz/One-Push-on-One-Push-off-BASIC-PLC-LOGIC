# One-Push-on-One-Push-off-BASIC-PLC-LOGIC
This repository contains a PLC program developed using Siemens SIMATIC Manager Step 7 that demonstrates a fundamental control logic: toggling an output state using a single push button. This "one push on, one push off" logic is achieved using positive edge detection to reliably register each button press.
